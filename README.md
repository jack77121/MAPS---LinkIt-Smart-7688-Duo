## Story
**M**icro **A**ir **P**ollution **S**ensing - MAPS

Air pollution is a hot topic in recent years, especially - **Particulate Matter**. Traditional sensing method, we can only depend on professional sensors/devices, with large volume, heave weight and insanity price.
Thanks to the technology, now we could build our own air pollution sensing station, with micro volume, light weight and the price is affordable :). With MAPS, you can sense air pollution any where, any time by yourself, you can also give it a battery module to increase its mobility!

For more air pollution sensing project, you can visit [LASS facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/1607718702812067/) and [LASS github](https://github.com/LinkItONEDevGroup/LASS), we are makers who sense anything in our environment!
